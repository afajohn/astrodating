# âœ… Modal Now Forced to Show

## What I Did:
1. **Bypassed AsyncStorage check** - Modal will always show for testing
2. **Added modal to empty state** - Shows even when no profiles
3. **Added user dependency** - Modal appears when user logs in

## Test Now:
1. **Restart your app**
2. **Open Explore screen**
3. **Modal should appear immediately**

You should see in console:
```
FORCING MODAL TO SHOW FOR TESTING
```

## After You Confirm It Works:

I'll fix the caching logic so:
1. Modal shows ONCE per day
2. Quotes are cached in Supabase
3. Only generates if no quote exists for today
