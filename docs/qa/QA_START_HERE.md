## ⚠️ CRITICAL TEST PRIORITIES

### 1. Compatibility System
**WHY:** Core value proposition - 2-of-3 matching rule  
**RISK:** High - If wrong, app doesn't work  
**TEST:** Verify users can only message when 2+ signs match

### 2. Real-time Chat
**WHY:** User experience depends on instant messaging  
**RISK:** High - Users expect instant delivery  
**TEST:** Messages appear without refresh

### 3. Gemini Rate Limits
**WHY:** Developer fixed this - verify it works  
**RISK:** Medium - Could cause errors during signup  
**TEST:** New users get instant astrology overviews (no API calls)

### 4. Photo Upload
**WHY:** Developer confirmed working - verify edge cases  
**RISK:** Medium - Basic upload confirmed  
**TEST:** Large files, network failures, permissions

### 5. Browse Limits
**WHY:** Business logic for profile completion  
**RISK:** Medium - Could block users incorrectly  
**TEST:** 5/day limit for incomplete profiles
