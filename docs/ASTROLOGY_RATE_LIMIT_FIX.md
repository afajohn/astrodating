# Fixing Gemini API Rate Limit Issues

## Problem

When new users sign up, the app tries to generate their astrology overview (3 signs Ã— 3 systems = 9 potential Gemini API calls per user), hitting rate limits quickly.

**Gemini API Free Tier Limits:**
- 15 requests per minute
- 1,500 requests per day
- Limited tokens per request

## Root Cause

The current implementation calls Gemini API whenever:
1. A new user views their Account screen
2. `AIAstrologicalProfile` component loads
3. Sign descriptions are not cached in Supabase

## Solution: Pre-populate Cache + Use Cafe Astrology Content

### Step 1: Run Pre-population Script

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Run the cache population script
npx tsx scripts/pre-populate-astrology-cache.ts
```

This script will:
- âœ… Populate **Western signs** with Cafe Astrology content (richest content)
- âœ… Populate **Chinese signs** with basic descriptions
- âœ… Populate **Vedic signs** with basic descriptions
- âœ… Skip Gemini API entirely for new user signups

### Step 2: Verify Cache Population

Check Supabase dashboard â†’ Table Editor â†’ `astrology_descriptions`

You should see 36 rows:
- 12 Western signs
- 12 Chinese signs  
- 12 Vedic signs

### Step 3: Test New User Signup

1. Sign up a new user
2. Navigate to Account screen
3. Verify astrology descriptions load instantly (no loading spinner)
4. Check browser console - should see "Using cached description" logs

## How It Works Now

```
Priority 1: Cafe Astrology Content (Western signs only)
    â†“ (if not found)
Priority 2: Supabase Cache (all signs)
    â†“ (if not found)  
Priority 3: Gemini AI API (only as last resort)
    â†“ (if fails)
Priority 4: Basic Fallback Description
```

## Benefits

- ðŸš€ **Zero API calls** for Western signs (uses pre-loaded Cafe Astrology content)
- ðŸš€ **Zero API calls** for Chinese/Vedic signs (uses pre-loaded basic descriptions)
- ðŸš€ **Instant loading** for all users
- ðŸ’° **Zero Gemini API costs** for signup flow
- ðŸ“ˆ **Unlimited scaling** - can handle thousands of signups per day

## Alternative: Use Comprehensive Astrology Website

If you want even richer content for Chinese and Vedic signs, you could:

1. **Use a reference site** like:
   - https://www.chinesezodiac.com/
   - https://www.astroved.com/ (Vedic)
   
2. **Scrape or manually input** their content into the cache

3. **Or subscribe to a paid astrology content API** like:
   - AstroAPI.com
   - Horoscope.com API
   - AstrologyAPI.com

But the current solution (Cafe Astrology + Basic descriptions) is sufficient for MVP.

## Monitoring

Check Gemini API usage:
1. Visit https://makersuite.google.com/
2. Click your project â†’ API usage
3. Should see minimal/quota usage after pre-population

## Rollback Plan

If you need to regenerate descriptions:

```sql
-- Clear cache in Supabase
TRUNCATE TABLE astrology_descriptions;

-- Then run the pre-population script again
npx tsx scripts/pre-populate-astrology-cache.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run the pre-population script
2. âœ… Verify cache is populated
3. âœ… Test new user signup
4. âœ… Monitor Gemini API usage (should be near zero)
5. âœ… Add photo upload functionality
6. âœ… Implement compatibility scoring
