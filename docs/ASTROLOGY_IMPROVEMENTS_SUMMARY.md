## ‚úÖ Improvements Made

### 1. Chinese Zodiac Enhancements

**Before:** Generic 75-word descriptions lacking cultural authenticity  
**After:** Culturally authentic descriptions with Five Elements and Yin/Yang classifications

#### Key Additions:
- ‚úÖ **Five Elements Integration**: Each sign now includes their specific element (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal)
- ‚úÖ **Yin/Yang Classification**: Proper energy balance for each sign
- ‚úÖ **Chinese Characters**: Added proper Chinese characters (Èº†, Áâõ, Ëôé, etc.)

**Example Improvement (Rat):**
```
Before: "Clever and resourceful, Rat individuals are natural problem-solvers..."
After: "The Rat (Èº†) embodies Water-Yang energy in the Chinese zodiac. You are intelligent, charming, and strategically ambitious. Your Water element makes you intuitive and adaptable, while Yang nature gives you dynamic initiative. Rats excel in business and politics through cleverness and resourcefulness. Your triad partners (Dragon, Monkey) create powerful alliances. Traditional Chinese wisdom sees Rats succeeding through thrift, bold strategy, and respect for hierarchy. Your lucky colors are blue and black..."

After: "Mesha (‡§Æ‡•á‡§∑), the first Rashi, ruled by Mars (Mangala). You embody Raja-guna and Pitta dosha, representing pure initiative energy in sidereal astrology. Your dharma is to initiate and lead through righteous action (Karma yoga). Your nakshatras are Ashwini (healing initiation), Bharani (transformation), and Krittika (cutting clarity). In Sanatana Dharma, Mars represents the warrior caste (Kshatriya). You incarnate to learn patience by serving others rather than forcing your will. Ayurvedically, you are Pitta dominant, benefiting from cooling foods and meditation..."
