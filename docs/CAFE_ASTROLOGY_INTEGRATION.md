# Cafe Astrology Content Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of Cafe Astrology-style content as the primary source for astrology profiles in the AstroDating app. The system uses a multi-tier content strategy to provide rich, comprehensive astrology information.

## Content Flow Hierarchy

The app now uses a four-tier content priority system:

```
Priority 1: Cafe Astrology Content (Western signs only)
         ↓
Priority 2: Supabase Database Cache
         ↓
Priority 3: Gemini AI Generation (conditional)
         ↓
Priority 4: Basic Fallback Descriptions
```
