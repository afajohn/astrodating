# Daily Cosmic Quotes Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive daily cosmic quotes feature that generates personalized quotes for all three astrology systems (Western, Chinese, and Vedic).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Service Layer Updates (`src/services/AstrologyContentService.ts`)

#### New Methods:

**`generateAllSystemDailyQuotes(userId: string)`**
- Generates daily quotes for all three astrology systems (Western, Chinese, Vedic)
- Fetches user's signs from all three systems
- Stores quotes with `astrology_system` metadata
- Returns quotes for all three systems

**`getTodayQuotes(userId: string)`**
- Fetches today's quotes from the database for all three systems
- Filters by date range (today's date)
- Organizes quotes by system (western, chinese, vedic)
- Returns structured quote data

#### Updated Method:
- `generateDailyQuoteForUser()` - Now documented as Western-only generation

### 2. New Component (`src/components/DailyCosmicQuotes.tsx`)

#### Features:
- **Tab System**: Switches between Western, Chinese, and Vedic quotes
- **Auto-Generate**: Automatically generates quotes if none exist for today
- **Smart Loading**: Shows loading state while fetching/generating quotes
- **Visual Design**: 
  - Category emojis (🌟 life, 💼 career, 💔 heartbreak, etc.)
  - Time-of-day emojis (🌅 morning, ☀️ afternoon, 🌙 evening)
  - Checkmarks for available quotes
- **User Experience**:
  - Displays current quote content
  - Shows sign name and category
  - Displays timestamp
  - Fallback UI if no quotes exist

#### Props:
- `onGenerateQuotes?` - Callback when quotes are generated

### 3. Database Migration (`add-quote-system-column.sql`)

```sql
-- Adds astrology_system column to astrology_quotes table
ALTER TABLE astrology_quotes 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS astrology_system VARCHAR(20) 
CHECK (astrology_system IN ('western', 'chinese', 'vedic'));
```

#### Changes:
- Adds `astrology_system` column to distinguish quotes by system
- Creates index for better query performance
- Sets default value for existing quotes ('western')
- Makes column NOT NULL after defaulting existing records

### 4. UI Integration (`src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx`)

Added Daily Cosmic Quotes component to Account screen:
- Positioned after Astrological Profile section
- Visible to authenticated users only
- Scrollable within the Account screen

## How It Works

### Quote Generation Flow:

1. **User Opens Account Screen**
   - Component checks for today's quotes using `getTodayQuotes()`

2. **No Quotes Found**
   - Automatically calls `generateAllSystemDailyQuotes()`
   - Generates three quotes in parallel (one per system)
   - Stores all quotes in database with `astrology_system` metadata

3. **Quotes Exist**
   - Displays today's quotes
   - Allows switching between systems via tabs

### Database Schema:

```typescript
interface AstrologyQuote {
  content: string;
  category: 'life' | 'career' | 'heartbreak' | 'finances' | 'losses' | 'health' | 'motivation';
  timeOfDay: 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'evening';
  sign: string;
  generatedAt: string;
  astrology_system: 'western' | 'chinese' | 'vedic'; // NEW
}
```

### Quote Categories:
- 🌟 Life - Personal growth guidance
- 💼 Career - Professional development
- 💔 Heartbreak - Relationship healing
- 💰 Finances - Money and abundance
- 🕊️ Losses - Coping with loss
- 💪 Health - Physical and mental wellness
- ⚡ Motivation - Inspiration and drive

### Time of Day Context:
- 🌅 Morning - Energizing and motivational quotes
- ☀️ Afternoon - Practical and career-focused quotes
- 🌙 Evening - Reflective and healing quotes

## Usage

### In App:
1. Navigate to Account screen
2. Scroll to "Your Daily Cosmic Quotes"
3. Select a system tab (Western, Chinese, or Vedic)
4. Read your personalized quote
5. Generate new quotes if none exist for today

### Programmatically:

```typescript
// Generate quotes for all systems
const quotes = await AstrologyContentService.generateAllSystemDailyQuotes(userId);

// Get today's quotes
const todayQuotes = await AstrologyContentService.getTodayQuotes(userId);
```

## Database Migration

### To Apply the Migration:

```bash
# Run the SQL migration on your Supabase database
psql -h <your-host> -U <user> -d <database> -f add-quote-system-column.sql
```

Or via Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Paste the contents of `add-quote-system-column.sql`
3. Run the query

## Features

### ✅ Completed:
- [x] Generate quotes for Western astrology
- [x] Generate quotes for Chinese astrology
- [x] Generate quotes for Vedic astrology
- [x] Store quotes with system metadata
- [x] Display quotes with tab navigation
- [x] Auto-generate if no quotes exist
- [x] Visual indicators (emojis, checkmarks)
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Database migration script
- [x] Integration with Account screen

### 🔮 Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Scheduling notifications for daily quotes
- [ ] Quote history viewer
- [ ] Share quotes functionality
- [ ] Favorite quotes feature
- [ ] Custom quote preferences
- [ ] Quote reminders

## Notes

- Quotes are generated per day (one set per day)
- Each system has its own unique quote
- Quotes are cached in database to avoid re-generation
- Migration is backward-compatible (defaults existing quotes to 'western')
- Component only renders for authenticated users

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Run the migration script** on your Supabase database
2. **Open the app** and navigate to Account screen
3. **View the quotes** - they should auto-generate if none exist
4. **Test tab switching** - switch between Western, Chinese, and Vedic
5. **Verify generation** - new quotes should appear on subsequent days

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the console logs for debugging information
- Verify database schema is updated
- Ensure user profile has birth_date set
- Check that Gemini API key is configured
