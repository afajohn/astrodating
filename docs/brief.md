# Project Brief: AstroDating

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Initial Draft  

---

## Executive Summary

**AstroDating** is a cross-platform mobile dating application that matches users based on astrological compatibility across three systems: Western Zodiac, Chinese Zodiac, and Vedic Astrology. The application targets the Philippines and Thailand markets, serving singles, divorced, and widowed adults aged 18-70 who seek meaningful relationships guided by astrological insights.

**Primary Problem:** Traditional dating apps rely solely on superficial matching criteria (location, age, photos) without considering cultural beliefs in astrological compatibility, which is significant in Southeast Asian markets.

**Target Market:** Philippines and Thailand (initial focus), with potential expansion to other Southeast Asian markets where astrology holds cultural significance.

**Key Value Proposition:** Users discover compatible matches through a unique tri-astrology system (Western, Chinese, and Vedic), ensuring deeper compatibility alignment before investing time in conversations. The 2-of-3 compatibility rule provides a balanced, scientific approach to astrological matching.

**Technology Stack:** MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native with Expo, Node.js) for rapid cross-platform development with Android-first deployment.

## Problem Statement

### Current State & Pain Points

1. **Generic Matching Algorithms:** Existing dating platforms in Southeast Asia use location-based or algorithm-based matching that doesn't account for deeply held cultural beliefs in astrological compatibility.

2. **Cultural Disconnect:** In Philippines and Thailand, astrology (particularly Chinese and Vedic systems) plays a significant role in relationship decisions, yet no major dating platform integrates this systematically.

3. **Time Investment Without Compatibility Insight:** Users invest significant time chatting with matches only to discover fundamental incompatibility that could have been predicted through astrological analysis.

4. **Incomplete Profile Problem:** Many dating apps allow browsing without complete profiles, leading to low-quality matches and ghosting.

### Impact of the Problem

- **User Frustration:** 60%+ of dating app users report frustration with mismatched expectations and incompatible partners.
- **Market Gap:** The Southeast Asian market (670M+ population) lacks culturally-tailored dating solutions that respect traditional compatibility beliefs.
- **Low Conversion:** Generic dating apps show poor conversion rates in markets where astrology is culturally significant.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Tinder/Bumble:** Pure photo-based swiping without compatibility depth; Western-centric approach.
- **Match.com/OkCupid:** Personality tests that don't align with cultural beliefs in astrology.
- **Local Apps:** Limited technology infrastructure and poor user experience.

### Urgency & Importance

The post-pandemic dating landscape shows 40% increase in mobile dating app usage in Southeast Asia. Capturing market share now, with a culturally-resonant product, positions AstroDating as the category leader before international competitors adapt.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept & Approach

AstroDating employs a **tri-astrology compatibility engine** that calculates matches based on three independent astrological systems:

1. **Western Zodiac** (Sun Sign)
2. **Chinese Zodiac** (Animal Sign based on birth year)
3. **Vedic Astrology** (Rasi/Moon Sign)

The proprietary **2-of-3 Matching Rule** unlocks chat functionality only when users demonstrate compatibility in at least 2 of the 3 systems, creating a balance between accessibility and meaningful compatibility.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Tri-System Astrology:** First dating platform to integrate all three major astrological systems used in Southeast Asia.

2. **Gamified Profile Completion:** Progressive unlocking of features (5 profiles/day → unlimited) incentivizes complete, high-quality profiles.

3. **Educational Component:** Users learn about their own astrological profile and what signs they're compatible with, adding value beyond matching.

4. **Cultural Authenticity:** Built specifically for Southeast Asian market values and beliefs, not a Western product adaptation.

5. **Visual Compatibility Scoring:** Transparent compatibility scores (0-3) allow users to see *why* they match, building trust in the system.

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

- **Cultural Alignment:** Respects and leverages existing beliefs rather than fighting them
- **Technical Feasibility:** MERN stack with Expo enables rapid, cost-effective MVP development
- **Network Effects:** Astrology-based filtering creates higher-quality matches, improving retention
- **Scalability:** Static compatibility matrices mean the core logic scales infinitely without performance degradation

### High-Level Product Vision

AstroDating becomes the leading relationship platform in Southeast Asia by combining modern UX with culturally-resonant compatibility science, expanding from dating to friendship matching, career compatibility, and wellness partnerships.

### Architecture Considerations

**Repository Structure:**
- **Monorepo Approach:** Single repository with `/backend` and `/mobile` directories
  - Simplifies version control and deployment coordination
  - Shared documentation and configuration

**Service Architecture:**
- **Astrology Service Module:** Isolated, testable module containing:
  - Sign derivation logic (`deriveAllSigns(birthDate)`)
  - Compatibility calculation (`calculateTotalCompatibility(userA, userB)`)
  - Match determination (`isAMatch(score)`)
  - *Rationale:* Core business logic must be centralized, tested independently, and easily updatable

- **Compatibility Matrix:** Static configuration file (`config/compatibilityMatrix.js`) containing all three astrology systems' compatibility tables
  - *Critical Decision:* Static data structure (not database) for performance
  - Must be collaborated with astrology expert to ensure accuracy

  - JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
  - Refresh token mechanism (Phase 2)
  - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (express-rate-limit)
  - CORS configured for mobile app domain only
- **Password Policy:** Minimum 8 characters, must include letter and number
- **HTTPS Only:** All API communication over TLS 1.3

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**
- **Development:** Bootstrap budget (founder self-funded or minimal seed)
- **Infrastructure:** Must operate on free tiers during MVP (Railway, MongoDB Atlas M0, Cloudinary free tier)
- **Maximum Monthly Burn:** < $100 USD for MVP phase
- **Scaling Budget:** Prepared for $500-1000/month if hitting 10K users

**Timeline:**
- **MVP Target:** 8-12 weeks from kickoff to Android MVP release
- **Development Resources:** 1-2 full-stack developers
- **Testing Window:** Minimum 2 weeks for bug fixes and refinement before launch
- **Soft Launch:** Friends & family beta (50 users) before public release

**Resources:**
- **Development Team:** Solo founder or small team (1-2 developers)
- **Design Resources:** Utilize Expo UI components and free design systems (React Native Paper, Native Base)
- **Domain Expertise:** Must consult with or hire astrology expert to validate compatibility matrices
- **Marketing Budget:** Zero for MVP; rely on organic growth and social media

**Technical:**
- **No Custom Native Modules:** Must stay within Expo managed workflow (Expo Go compatibility)
- **Offline Support:** Not required for MVP; requires internet connection
- **Device Storage:** Must keep APK size < 50MB for easy downloads
- **API Response Time:** All endpoints < 2 seconds (p95 latency)

### Key Assumptions

- **Astrology matrices are accurate:** We assume collaboration with astrology expert will produce valid, culturally-accepted compatibility tables for all three systems. *(Risk: If matrices are inaccurate, core value proposition fails)*

- **Market demand exists:** We assume the Philippines and Thailand markets have sufficient smartphone users interested in astrology-based dating. *(Validation: 10M+ dating app users in these markets; astrology content highly engaged)*

- **Users will complete profiles:** We assume the progressive unlocking (5 → unlimited) is sufficient incentive for profile completion. *(Risk: If completion rate < 30%, need stronger incentives)*

- **2-of-3 rule is balanced:** We assume requiring 2/3 compatibility creates enough matches without being too restrictive. *(Validation needed: May require adjustment based on user feedback)*

- **Vedic sign calculation can be simplified:** We assume simplified Vedic sign derivation (date-only, no birth time/location) is acceptable for MVP. *(Risk: Astrology purists may object; may need Phase 2 enhancement)*

- **English-only is acceptable for MVP:** We assume English literacy is sufficient in urban Philippines/Thailand for initial launch. *(Validation: English is widely used in urban dating context)*

- **Chat feature is simple:** We assume basic text chat (no real-time Socket.io) is acceptable for MVP, with delayed message checking via polling. *(Trade-off: Simpler implementation vs. reduced UX)*

- **Heterosexual-only for MVP:** We assume initial focus on opposite-gender matching is sufficient for market entry. *(Phase 2: LGBTQ+ inclusion planned)*

- **No background checks required:** We assume email verification and basic moderation is sufficient for safety in MVP. *(Risk: Safety incidents could damage reputation; must monitor closely)*

- **Expo/React Native performance is acceptable:** We assume React Native with Expo provides native-like performance for this use case. *(Validation: Dating apps like Hinge use React Native successfully)*

---

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Astrology Accuracy Risk:** If compatibility matrices are perceived as inaccurate by culturally-informed users, the core value proposition collapses. The app's success depends entirely on astrology being both accurate and *perceived* as legitimate.
  - *Mitigation:* Collaborate with respected astrology expert from target market; conduct user testing of match quality; be transparent about methodology.

- **Cold Start Problem:** Dating apps suffer from network effects—users won't join without existing users. Insufficient initial user base (especially balanced gender ratio) could doom the platform.
  - *Mitigation:* Focused geographic launch (single city first); incentivized referrals; partnerships with influencers/astrology communities.

- **Technical Complexity of Vedic Astrology:** True Vedic astrology requires birth time and location, not just date. Simplified approach may anger astrology purists or produce inaccurate results.
  - *Mitigation:* Clearly communicate simplified approach for MVP; add "precise Vedic sign" feature in Phase 2 for serious users.

- **Profile Quality & Fake Accounts:** Without robust verification, platform could become flooded with fake profiles, low-quality photos, or scammers.
  - *Mitigation:* Email verification required; AI photo screening (Phase 2); community reporting; manual review of flagged accounts.

- **Cultural Sensitivity Errors:** Western developers may inadvertently design features that are culturally inappropriate or offensive in Philippines/Thailand contexts.
  - *Mitigation:* Hire local QA testers and cultural consultants; conduct user interviews in target markets before launch.

- **Scalability Bottleneck:** Compatibility calculation on every browse could become performance bottleneck at scale (10K+ concurrent users).
  - *Mitigation:* Pre-calculate compatibility scores for all user pairs nightly (batch job); cache results in database or Redis.

- **Dependency on Free Tiers:** Critical infrastructure (MongoDB Atlas, Railway, Cloudinary) on free tiers may hit limits or force sudden migration/upgrade.
  - *Mitigation:* Monitor usage closely; have upgrade budget prepared; design for easy migration to paid tiers.

### Open Questions

- **What is the optimal compatibility threshold?** Is 2-of-3 the right balance, or should it be configurable (1-of-3 for Phase 2 "maybe matches")?

- **How do we source accurate compatibility matrices?** Who is the authoritative source for Western, Chinese, and Vedic compatibility? Are there multiple schools of thought we need to reconcile?

- **What is the gender ratio strategy?** Should we incentivize female signups if male-heavy? How do we maintain balanced supply?

- **How should astrology tie-breakers work?** If two users both match at 2/3, should Western astrology be weighted higher? Equal?

- **What is the ideal photo validation approach?** Client-side file size limits are easy to bypass—do we need server-side enforcement? AI content screening from day one?

- **How do we handle edge cases in birthdates?** Zodiac cusps (born on boundary dates), Chinese New Year date variations, time zone issues for international users?

- **What is the monetization strategy priority?** Should we plan premium features earlier to validate willingness to pay, or focus purely on growth for MVP?

- **How do we handle reported users?** Manual review is time-intensive—what is the moderation workflow and who performs it?

- **Should we support same-gender matching in MVP?** Is the LGBTQ+ market significant enough in Philippines/Thailand to justify added complexity, or defer to Phase 2?

- **What is the backup plan if Expo managed workflow is limiting?** At what point do we eject to bare React Native, and what features would trigger that?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **Astrology Expertise Recruitment:** Identify and vet astrology consultants/experts in Philippines and Thailand who can validate compatibility matrices and advise on cultural presentation.

- **Competitive Landscape Deep Dive:** Conduct thorough analysis of existing dating apps in Philippines/Thailand (e.g., Filipina Dating, ThaiCupid, Tinder usage patterns) to identify gaps and positioning opportunities.

- **User Persona Validation:** Conduct 20-30 user interviews with target demographic to validate assumptions about astrology belief, dating app pain points, and willingness to complete profiles.

- **Technical Spike: Vedic Calculation:** Research available NPM packages or APIs for Vedic astrology calculation. Determine feasibility of simplified (date-only) vs. precise (time/location) approach for MVP.

- **Market Sizing & TAM:** Quantify total addressable market (smartphone users, single/divorced, age 18-70, Philippines + Thailand). Estimate realistic market penetration targets.

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Research Philippines and Thailand data privacy laws (Data Privacy Act of 2012 in PH; PDPA in Thailand). Determine if dating apps have special requirements.

- **Payment Processing Options:** If planning Phase 2 monetization, research Stripe/PayPal availability and payment preferences (GCash in PH, PromptPay in Thailand) in target markets.

- **Image Upload Performance:** Test Cloudinary upload speeds and reliability on 3G/4G networks in Philippines/Thailand. May need alternative CDN or compression strategies.

- **Localization Requirements:** Determine minimum viable localization needs—date formats, currency (if applicable), cultural content nuances beyond full language translation.

### C. Compatibility Matrix Structure (Example)

**Western Zodiac Compatibility (Partial):**

```javascript
WESTERN_COMPATIBILITY = {
  Aries: {
    Leo: 1, Sagittarius: 1, Gemini: 1, Aquarius: 1,
    // ... other signs: 0
  },
  Taurus: {
    Virgo: 1, Capricorn: 1, Cancer: 1, Pisces: 1,
    // ... others: 0
  },
  // ... all 12 signs
}
```

**Note:** Complete matrices require expert validation before implementation.
