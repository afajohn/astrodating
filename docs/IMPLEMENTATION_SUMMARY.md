- Ethical: Intellectual property protection
- Technical: No web scraping tools available

### ‚ùå Cannot Access Private/Internal Links
- Limited to publicly accessible, searchable content

- No programmatic page traversal

### ‚ùå Cannot Reproduce Exact Content
- Copyright protection on their content
- Must create original content inspired by their style
- Must respect intellectual property rights

## What Has Been Created Instead

   - 12 detailed Western zodiac sign profiles
   - Each with 10+ sections of detailed information
   - Matches their depth and professionalism

2. **Rising Sign Descriptions**
   - All 12 Ascendants covered
   - Focus on outward presentation
   - How others perceive you

3. **Service Architecture**
   - Multi-tier priority system
   - Database caching
