## 🚨 CRITICAL AREAS TO TEST

### 1. Compatibility System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**The 2-of-3 matching rule MUST work correctly:**
- Users with 3 matching signs → Can message ✅
- Users with 2 matching signs → Can message ✅
- Users with 1 matching sign → Cannot message ❌
- Users with 0 matching signs → Cannot message ❌

**Files to check:**
- `src/services/CompatibilityService.ts`
- `src/services/AstrologyService.ts`
- `src/screens/ProfileDetailScreen.tsx` (lines 267-305)

### 2. Real-time Chat (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Messages MUST appear instantly without refresh:**
- User A sends message
- User B sees it appear immediately
- No manual refresh needed
- Unread badges update

**Files to check:**
- `src/screens/ChatDetailScreen.tsx` (lines 66-112)
- `src/services/MessageService.ts` (lines 248-338)

### 3. Gemini API Fix (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Verify new users get instant descriptions:**
- No API calls during signup
- Descriptions load from Supabase cache
- 36 descriptions pre-populated

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check Supabase → Table Editor → astrology_descriptions
# Should see 36 rows (12 Western + 12 Chinese + 12 Vedic)
```

### 4. Photo Upload (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**You said it's working, but test edge cases:**
- Upload large files
- Upload when network fails
- Delete photos
- Set profile photo

**Files to check:**
- `src/screens/PhotoManagementScreen.tsx`
- `src/services/PhotoUploadService.ts`

### 5. Browse Limits (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Incomplete profiles should be limited:**
- No photos → 5 profiles/day max
- Has 5 photos → Unlimited browsing
- Daily reset at midnight UTC

**Files to check:**
- `src/services/ProfileService.ts` (getExploreProfiles method)
- `src/services/ProfileService.ts` (updateBrowseCount method)

## 🐛 ISSUES I'M AWARE OF

- **Impact:** Low - Could show all 5 photos
- **Fix Time:** 1 hour

### 3. Daily Browse Reset (Needs Testing)
